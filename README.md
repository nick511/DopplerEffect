# DopplerEffect

Light from moving objects will appear to have different wavelengths depending on the relative motion of the source and the observer.

Observers looking at an object that is moving away from them see light that has a longer wavelength than it had when it was emitted (a redshift), while observers looking at an approaching source see light that is shifted to shorter wavelength (a blueshift).
